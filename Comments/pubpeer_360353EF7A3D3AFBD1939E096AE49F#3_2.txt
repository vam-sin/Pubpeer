#2 We appreciate your effort for highlighting the discrepancies in the gel images but it happened inadvertently during assembling of the data. In accordance to the matter raised by the publisher and with the consent of the publisher the regenerated data along with raw files were submitted to the journal. The publisher appreciated our efforts and indicated that our replicated data supports most results as reported in the original figures. In addition they raised their fresh concern about experimental data with loading control. However the paper was retracted. Subsequently we have done the additional experiments with loading control which authenticate the findings made in our paper.
