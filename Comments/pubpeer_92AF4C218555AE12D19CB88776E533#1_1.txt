Since the most usual cause of downtime of an apparatus containing an oven is the heater winding, your designing it to be external to the vacuum system has obvious advantages. However you do not discuss the alternative of using thermocoax, possibly because you have not come across it. It can be best described as a miniature version of the heating rods used in domestic grills and ovens. Thermocoax has been successfully used in vacuum systems. You may find the book by C B Lucas entitled: Atomic and molecular beams: Production and collimation and published in 2013 useful for designing atomic beams, including strontium, and predicting their properties.
