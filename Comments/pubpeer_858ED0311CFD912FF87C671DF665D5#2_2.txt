Lands 1 -3 are the same in C and D to show the experimental conditions using the wild type probe. Land 1, probe only; Land 2/3, under control or RANKL treatment, showing decreased binding with RANKL treatment ( lower arrow). The differences are in Lane 4 in C and Lanes 4/5 in D. 3C, lane 4, demonstrating the specificity of the probe, as the binding was blocked by 100x cold probe. 3D, lane 4 showing the binding of PARP-1 in this complex that resulted supershift (upper arrow), while the control IgG did not.
