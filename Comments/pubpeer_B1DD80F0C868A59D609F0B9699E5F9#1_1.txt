Study fails to analyse underlying causes and responsibility - the authors should have spoken to Juul before publishing
Juul has provided a forceful response to this paper: Study highlights influence of illegal compatible products https://newsroom.juul.com/2019/07/02/study-highlights-influence-of-illegal-compatible-products/
At the time of this study, third-party users generated well over 99.99 percent of the Instagram content related to JUUL products. Additionally, JUUL Labs did not sponsor any “influencer” activities on any social media platform, including Instagram, from March to May 2018, when the research was conducted. As a result, this study does not measure JUUL Labs’ social-media presence as alleged, but instead provides a snapshot of the inappropriate social-media content perpetuated by others, including manufacturers of illegal and potentially dangerous compatible products that aggressively promote their products on social media to youth.
What I find disturbing about this study is that authors apparently did not approach Juul to ask about its Instagram activity over the study period or what Juul thinks accounts for activity with its brand. In publishing such a critical paper on a particular company and brand, surely basic journalistic and research ethics should have led the authors to confirm relevant data with Juul or at least listen to the company's interpretation?
In fact, a completely different story emerges from the data as qualified by Juul's statement. This is that FDA's failure to control newly-introduced Juul look-a-likes (which are illegal if introduced after 8 August 2016) is spawning a lawless industry driven by social media and in conflict with Juul's efforts to control sales of its products to youth. The study does not interrogate the underlying reality and I think Juul is right to react strongly.
