In the first paragraph of "Results and Discussion," the authors state, "Both Miraluma and B.E.S.T. were compared with multiple biopsy specimens obtained from 10 women studied using both methods[,]" and references Figure 4.
The second paragraph states, "Between February of 1999 and June of 2005, a total of 992 women and 4 men were studied using BEST©℗ imaging[,]" and again references Figure 4.
The third paragraph state, "In comparing 100 women, we were delighted to have the additional diagnostic support of several surgeons including Dr. William Dooley, who provided biopsy and ductoscopy information in some of the women. "
Could the authors clarify which of these three studies generated the statistics cited in paragraph 4 of the "Results and Discussion" and accompanying Figures 6 and 7?
This paragraph reads,
When the results of MCA were analyzed and graphically displayed, the normal breast tissue showed MCA values of 144 ± 30 with a 95% confidence (CI) interval from 138 to 150. Inflammatory tissue with its greater mitochondrial activity and blood supply revealed MCA values of 229 ± 50 with a 95% CI from 219 to 240, while the still higher metabolic (mitochondria) activity with associated angiogenesis typifying cancers had MCAs of 446 ± 80 and a 95% CI from 404 to 489. These results are shown in Figure 6 with bar graph comparisons of the three shown in Figure 7.
I agree with Actinopolyspora, and I too have serious concerns about this paper.
Did the patients whose breast images are shown in Figure 1/3/5/9/11/12/13/14/15/16/17 give permission to use their results in this publication? In several cases, these images show dates of procedures, which make the data potentially identifiable. In one case, a male patient with breast cancer is mentioned in relationship with date of procedure, which makes this data even more identifiable. These appear to be serious breaches of HIPAA regulations and publication ethics.
The Results section mentions several groups of patients who are not mentioned in the Methods, nor is it clear that they gave permission to use their results in this study. These include a group of 996 patients whose results are shown in Figure 4; another group of 205 patients whose results are discussed on page 3, and a group of 327 women shown in Figure 16 and Table 1.
No statements are included about IRB approval or consent. I am very concerned that women who went to The Camelot Foundation or to Oklahoma University for breast imaging were not aware their results have been used for this study, or that their images were used showing potentially identifying information.
