It is stated that AKT and p-AKT have been probed on the same membranes. HSC70 may be from a different membrane (but in that case it shall not be used as a loading control).
Interesting discussion about WB, I have learned a lot from it. Anybody can tell if is it a good approach to use HSC70 antibody with AKT antibody? HSC70 is about 70 kDa, and AKT is about 65 kDa. They are too close to each other. So if I use them, I cannot cut the membrane for a parallel labeling, and it seems difficult to distinguish them if the two antibodies are used on the same membrane. Any suggestion?

This was a potential image duplication. The authors used loading control from a parallel blot. In this case HSC70 and AKT are more similar than expected.
I wonder what is the reason of not showing the uncut gels. The correction also corrected western blots, which were not in question. These western blots are in the supplementary information and they have increased brightness contrast to burn out the background. This adjustment was made during the correction. What is the reason doing that?
It is correct to point out manipulations, duplications, splicings and other irregularities with western blot images on PubPeer and For Better Science. But the unpleasant attacks on scientists for not performing blots in a panel on the same membrane is based on flawed assumptions and non-evidence based thinking. To imply that these scientists are cheating, dishonest or using inferior practices, and calling for corrections or retractions to their articles, is wrong. By all means debate the technical aspects of what is actually a complex technique with many variables so that we can advance and improve western blotting for the future, but please refrain from this uninformed campaign, which is unfortunately beginning to influence publishers, to impose a flawed doctrine based on poorly thought through western blotting strategy. I explain why this thinking is flawed, and suggest a better way forward, below. Thank you for reading.
The call for membrane stripping is unsuitable and less reliable than a parallel gel
Membrane stripping would have been required in the majority of the western blotting experiments criticized on this site in order to achieve the doctrine of "blots from the same gel". Western blot membrane stripping has been shown to be problematic (PMIDs: 25852189; 19892193; 19523435; 27263489; 11554725; 25059473), and there is no evidence that it is superior to running a fresh, separate gel in parallel when the proteins are a similar size. It is likely inferior, resulting in larger variances when factoring in independent biological repeat experiments. It is difficult to completely remove antibody signals with even harsher stripping buffers, and then it is likely you remove sample protein from the membrane (PMIDs: 25852189; 19892193; 19523435; 27263489; 11554725; 25059473).
Do the accusers propose we all blot for p-AKT T308, strip the membrane, probe for p-AKT S473, strip the membrane, probe for total AKT? What if I want to blot for e.g. 4 or 10 or 30 histone modifications or entire families of 5-10 proteins of similar size on a set of samples? These are very common real world scenarios. Indeed, the more you mess with membranes (strip, reprobe, eat, sleep, wash, re-secondary, wash, re-ECL, develop/scan, repeat), unsurprisingly, the weaker the signal is each time, the patchier the signal, the worse the background and the less reliable they become until you are struggling to see any signal at all (PMID: 19523435).
There are many calls on PubPeer and For Better Science for papers that do not have blots from the same membrane to be corrected or even retracted, which would mean correcting or retracting literally thousands of life sciences papers. Back to the dark ages then. All based on the faith position that membrane stripping (or an alternative) is more reliable than a parallel western blot transfer. I suspect many regard this as nonsense and agree that membrane stripping and alternatives actually raise at least as many concerns and uncertainties than running a gel in parallel, and in fact I can see that they do from the majority of blots in papers. Do you not think we would all be rubbing our hands together with glee at the opportunity to save all those hours and resources if membrane stripping was reliable? There is a reason it is used sparingly and with suspicion, not because we are cowboys and girls trying to cheat you and science with bad controls, but because we really do care about the quality of our western blots and know better.
Given the problems with membrane stripping (PMIDs: 25852189; 19892193; 19523435; 27263489; 11554725; 25059473), the more reliable and diligent approach is surely to run a fresh gel in parallel and probe separately, and then repeat your experiments. We will come on to controlling for loading and transfer in a moment. Other methods may better allow re-use of the same membrane than stripping but these are not widely employed (PMID: 19523435; PMID: 26139277), and recently commercially available stripping buffers claim to be making improvements (of course) but there is little evidence for this as yet.
However, fluorescence based western techniques utilizing differentially labelled secondary antibodies raised against distinct species may allow for more reliable simultaneous (or sequential) blotting, such as phospho and total, and eliminate the need for stripping or a separate gel in some cases (PMID: 24561642). This is becoming more routine. But with the systems available to most scientists you are still limited by the number of species (anyone got 5 µL of dragon anti-acetyl H3 K18 I can pinch?) available, which is typically at best mouse and rabbit for most proteins of interest (POIs). For many experiments you will still not be able to blot for everything on one membrane. Furthermore, as many of you will have experienced, for many antibodies/POIs, fluorescence based methods are just not always sensitive enough for detection compared to ECL and film. And has anyone definitively shown that, e.g. for phospho and total, these antibodies do not compete with one another for binding to the same protein on the membrane? Antibodies are huge and other techniques have shown that the ratio of phospho:total is often very low even under stimulated conditions, so you probably would not notice unwanted competition between antibodies.
The call for single loading control blots on every blot is scientifically flawed and risks artifacts
“How do we know about transfer or loading if you don’t do a loading control on each blot?” This has become a persistent, and often vehement stream of somewhat self-righteous criticism, and unfortunately some publishers and guidelines (no doubt in good faith, but also ignorance) have begun to take note. Performing a loading control such as HSP90, GADPH, tubulin or beta-actin on every membrane is not only time-consuming, practically challenging (e.g. size overlap with POIs), expensive and journal space/data-consuming, it is flawed for simple reasons.
Why? Because those proteins are present in your samples at tens, hundreds or thousands of times the level of typical POIs. For instance, across four cell types of different tissue origin the number of copies of HSP90 was ~1000-2000-fold that of AKT1 and ~50 times that of ERK2; copies of GAPDH were ~500-1500 times that of AKT1 and 10-50 times that of ERK2; copies of alpha tubulin (TUBA1B plus TUBA1C) were ~500-800-fold that of AKT1 and 10-25 times that of ERK2 (PMID: 25225357). That really does matter. Many studies have shown that you are very likely out of the linear signal range for these control proteins when you are within the linear signal range for your POI: that is, a large error in loading will appear as little change in signal of your supposed loading control (PMIDs: 25540176; 24738055; 25852189; 30800670; 25059473; 23709336; 24023619; 18571732; 21186791; 23454168; 24561642). How very misleading. For highly expressed proteins, both membrane transfer (proteins binding in layers with only top layer accessible to antibody), and the detection method signal, are vulnerable to saturation, and contribute to the lack of linearity at typical protein loading amounts (23709336; http://tiny.cc/1oq08y). In addition, signals from these proteins are often so intense that they are prone to rapidly “burning out” or quenching, resulting in a halo appearance and other problems, further compounding this lack of utility (PMID: 9509338).
Those who stand next to me in the developing room and do their 0.96 second actin/GAPDH/tubulin exposures, whilst less experienced blotters exclaim “wow I can see the signal with my eyes”, must realise that something is not right. I suspect people know that these “controls” are meaningless but the lanes always came out curiously, and handily, evenly loaded each time, and anyway those guys at PubPeer and For Better Science recommend it so it is all good. No. In order for loading controls like HSP90/GAPDH/beta-actin/tubulin to be useful, in a typical scenario you need to be loading less than 1-10 µg (PMIDs: 24738055; 25852189; 21186791; 23709336; 24023619; 18571732; 30800670). At < 1-10 µg a large proportion of POIs are out of their linear range or undetectable altogether, and therefore separate gels are necessary. But the loading control in this case is at least importantly demonstrates that our samples were effectively normalized by the protein assay, instead of being essentially meaningless.
You could spend your time (life) validating novel loading control proteins with a similar expression level/linear range to your protein of interest and probe every blot as appropriate. And again, this saturation and non-linearity problem may be improved versus ECL with fluorescence western blotting techniques, but the problem still very much exists, and these techniques have the alternative downside that high density signals can quench (PMID: 25540176; 25852189; 24561642; 24023619). Trying to control the signal and saturation of signal at the level of antibody concentration is particularly challenging and problematic, and ineffective compared to control at the level of protein loading (PMID: 18571732; 26287535; 30054510).
In addition, if you want to compare expression of a POI in different tissue or even different differentiation states within a tissue, using standard loading controls is typically not helpful as the expression of a single control will vary greatly between samples (PMID: 24023619; PMID: 22916200; PMID: 23454168). In fact, even just the confluence of the same cells can disproportionately affect expression of GAPDH and alpha-tubulin, invalidating any comparison or normalisation to the POI (PMID: 20171969); in that scenario you would be better off not normalizing and going with your protein assay.
Now that we have established loading controls as advocated by many on PubPeer and For Better Science are misleading, what does probing for this single protein with outside of the linear signal range tell us about transfer quality? Well, it tells us that* some* protein was transferred to a narrow sliver of membrane.
Lastly, but really rather importantly, what about IP and pull-down experiments – are these to be dismissed if there are no independent control proteins blotted for on the same membrane? Should I disregard every RAC-GTP pull-down ever performed? Good luck getting GST in to a meaningful range on the same blot. This thinking would again send cell biology back to the dark ages.
But do not despair, as many of you I am sure are aware, there is I think good evidence now for a simple solution to nearly all of these issues.
What is the best way forward?
So if membrane stripping and single standard loading controls cause artifacts, are unhelpful and are inefficient, but there is no chance these guys on PubPeer or For Better Science will trust that our loading and transfers were sound (how do I know these PubPeer types properly covered the membrane with antibody, how do I know their jealous and competitive colleague did not spit in their block, and how do I know they did not accidentally check their mobile phone for a split second in the dark room resulting in perfect artifactual bands, I hear you ask?), what can we do? Well, better results are achieved by monitoring several control proteins at once (PMID: 25852189), but this has obvious issues of practicality. Why not extend this to the entire protein set in your sample? Surely a far superior, rigorous and more versatile method (PMIDs: 18571732; 26004848; 20206115; 23747530; 22929699; 24023619). Well, several companies offer reversible quantifiable total protein stains that you can use to assess and linearly quantify your transfer, either before or after immunoblotting. Alternatively, you can use cheap Coomassie (or alternatively Ponceau) stain, which has been shown to have excellent proportionality with protein level (PMID: 21186791; PMID: 20206115). But I suspect many or most of those criticized did already check their membranes with Coomassie – have we come full circle?
#23
Simple remedy that always existed and practiced for difficulties with stripping and re-probing blots- more gel-blots. No one prevents authors from doing a separate blot for each protein or protein modification of their interest with loading control of choice probed in the same gel-blots. No one ever recommends to probe all your proteins of your interest in one single gel-blot, but to have appropriate loading controls in the same blot. I see no reason why this cannot be done? Most of the points raised in #23 do not have enough merit to warrant further discussion unless we want authors of each paper to devise their own rules about how to normalize western blot data and how to report their data.
The problem is not that parallel blots have been used here. The problems are: #1 the lack of loading control of the blots, #2 the misleading statement that the blots were stripped and probed again for various antibodies (while some of the presented blots are unlikely to be identical), and #3 that the Western blot method reference lacks information on the applied Western blot procedure.
