Just wanted to set the record straight: I left uBiome in December 2018.
The questions I am asking about Richard Fleming's papers have nothing to do with my previous employer. I am asking them on behalf of my current company, Harbers Bik LLC, as a research integrity specialist.
Elisabeth Bik, PhD, Harbers Bik LLC.
Dr. Bik - Sincerely appreciate your contribution to this thread, and I'm sorry that you too have been subject to ad hominem attacks.
Perhaps the papers published by Dr. Fleming and his co-authors, and their contributions here on PubPeer, would be fodder for a published case study on research ethics and identifying possible scientific misconduct. This situation appears to contain many of the elements of your recent course on research misconduct:
Plagiarism in scientific papers
Fake peer reviews
Predatory journals
Predatory conferences
Image manipulation
How to alert journals and institutions of corrections and retractions
One element you did not appear to cover in the January course are responses of authors to questions about their research, and the various risks to individuals who publicly identify possible research misconduct.
Which TV program would you like to appear on to discuss in the light of day? I have already included you in a Radio Interview soon to be aired.
Several of these authors have published a new paper with similar citation issues in a non-indexed journal, available here: https://irispublishers.com/acrci/pdf/ACRCI.MS.ID.000524.pdf
