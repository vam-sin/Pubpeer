I personally do not think that there is any intentional aberration of results conducted by the author.The overlap is highly coincidental as is the case in many histological specimens.The scrutiny of histological samples cannot be so straight forward.Overlapping of some part does not conclusively proof that the authors have resorted to dishonest means.Though I would like to appreciate the authors for their reply.However I do not think an erratum submission is required,although this totally depends on the authors.And lastly my learned peer, Hoya Camphorifolia must have overlooked that the authors are giving the histology from the same group of mice.Hence field overlap is quite natural.

I don't think anyone intends to accuse the authors of dishonesty! Instead, there has been a mix-up of slides, so that two overlapping enlargements of one slide have been mistakenly used to illustrate two separate conditions. Everyone will be grateful for the authors' replacement of one of the slides with an image from the appropriate condition.
However, in their proposed replacement, if two of the panels are again overlapping enlargements from a single larger image, this is not ideal as an illustration of the repeated appearance - that was what I intended to convey in comment #3.
