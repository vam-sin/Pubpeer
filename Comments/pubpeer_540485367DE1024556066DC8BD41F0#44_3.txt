The figures are copyrighted to the primary author and as such they remain the property of the primary author. I do not need to cite my own property.

@ Richard M Flemming That's not how the creative commons license works. The copyrights to the images belong to the Author(s) and the publisher as can be clearly seen in the creative comments license statement at the bottom of the 2011 publication (quoted below for ease 1) and in section 4 of the creative commons license agreement.
Furthermore self citation has been a basic component of scientific publishing for almost as long as scientific publications have existed.

I'm delighted you think so. However, that's not copyright law. And since all the figures and material within it are my copyrighted material it is not the property of others. The U.S. Constitutional copyright Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 is Supreme Law of the land. If you want to practice law, go to Law School. Your comments are harassment, bullying and your behavior is stalking.

#4 is correct. This isn't an issue of copyright law, it's an issue of basic publishing ethics.
