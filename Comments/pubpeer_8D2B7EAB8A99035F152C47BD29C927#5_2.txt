Thanks a lot for Dr. Hoya Camphorifolia's comments. We used the SEM of GO as that of Al2O3/EG by our mistake. Therefore, we have applied to withdraw this manuscript. Dear Dr. or Prof. Editor, Re: Enhanced adsorption of Eu(III) on mesoporous Al2O3/expanded graphite composites investigated by macroscopic and microscopic techniques, Dalton. Trans., 2012, 41, 13388-13394. DOI: 10.1039/c2dt31510f)
I am writing you to inform you that we have to withdraw the abovementioned manuscript for further consideration , due to a technical reason (Figure 1D is graphene oxide rather than Al2O3/EG). I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the withdrawal of this article. Once again, thank you very much for your consideration and time. With kind regards, Yours sincerely
