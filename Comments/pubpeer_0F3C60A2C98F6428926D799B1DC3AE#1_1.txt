cytoplasmic YAP staining in HEK293 cells cultured in non confluent conditions has never been observed before. the authors state that "All of our experiments were performed with HEK293 cells obtained directly from Graham et al. (1977) and cultured in our laboratory since then. YAP is primarily cytoplasmic in our HEK293 cells, which tend to grow in clumps on a standard cell culture plate or glass coverslip (Fig. 3E)." some groups use HEK293A, which may explain in part the difference, but many use HEK293 and consistently observe nuclear localization. so, one wonders what the others groups have been using so far, and which of these cell lines underwent a drift compared to the others? this should cast serious doubts on the reliability of HEK293 cells a s a model system for YAP.
