Can you clarify why you think 3D is supposed to be "untreated", as you claim?
From both the Figure Legend and the Results text, it sounds as though both 3C and 3D are the same condition: both are 14 dpf, and both contain intracellular symbionts of SSB01. Thus, as far as I can tell, the 14 dpf panel in 3E seems to be the same condition as in 3D, not a different condition.
After better reading, I now realize that both images are from larvae in presence of SSB01. I apologize. However, text and fig legend could be clearer, and image duplication was not disclosed, as far as I can see.
#2 My mistake. few minutes after my first comment I posted another one to apologize for my mistake, but comment is strangly still in moderation. The only suboptimal aspect of Fig 3 is that image reuse is not disclosed.
