The authors claimed that molecular markers were used to select/pyramid “three powdery mildew (Pm) resistance genes (Pm2, Pm4b, and Pm8), two stripe rust (Yr) resistance genes (YrZH84 and Yr9), two pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) resistance genes (PHS1 and PHS4A), and certain high-quality genes” in the development of Zhengmai 7698. These markers were developed/published from 2003 to 2015 (see Table 1). However, Zhengmai 7698 was developed and released in 2000s, and application for “Plant Variety Protection Right” was filed on Jan. 22, 2008. According to data Xu Wei-gang provided to Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) when he applied for the membership of CAE in 2011, the accumulated growing area of Zhengmai 7698 was over 6.2 million mu (1 mu = 1/15 ha) . Of the markers they “used” to develop Znengmai 7698, eight were developed after Zhengmai 7698 was released (2008 – 2015). How could these guys use these markers, which were not available before 2008, to develop Zhengmai 7698?
It is funny that these guys “used marker-assisted selection to select Pm8”, a powdery mildew resistance gene that has been overcome in China for decades. Because of the extensive deployment of the 1B/1R translocation lines carrying Pm8, Pm8 has been ineffective in China for many years. It is difficult to imagine that a wheat breeder spent resources to select a useless gene! I notice that few, if not none, of molecular markers they “used” (precisely: they claimed they used) are diagnostic markers. Therefore, these markers cannot be used in marker-assisted selection unless they have evidence showing that at least one of the three parental lines carry the target genes. Unfortunately, the authors did not provide any such kind of evidence. Given that many of the markers they “used” were developed after Zhengzhou7698 was released by other labs, I strongly doubt they have ever done any marker-assisted selection work when they developed Zhengmai7698.
Pm4b was identified in European germplasm VPM1, TP229, ELS and Weihenstephan M1. There is no evidence that these germplasm have been used in wheat breeding in Henan province, and more importantly, they are absent in the pedigrees of the three parental lines of Zhengmai7698. How was it possible that these authors find Pm4b in Zhengmai7698?
