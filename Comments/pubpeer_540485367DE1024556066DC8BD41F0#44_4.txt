I have seen these same KETO stalkers before using the same fungal name identifiers attacking science that they did not like so they could promote through stalking, bullying and harassment their agenda. Actinopolyspora Biskrensis, Paraburkholderia Zhejiangensis and Lyophyllum Pulvis-horrei are not only stalkers, harassers and bullies but cowards. I have reported you on these comments and am recommending that you be prosecuted accordingly.
