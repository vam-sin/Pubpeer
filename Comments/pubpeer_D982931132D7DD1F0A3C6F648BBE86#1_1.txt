"We consider delay activity to be any task-related change in neural activity that spans the interval between a stimulus and the behavioural response in a WM delay task."
So, in an organ containing billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, any activity that doesn't remain unchanged (with respect, at least, to the means of measurement), during the period when a subject is performing a specific "task," is directly related to the achievement of the demands of this task. It's truly fantastic how neuroscientists today can freeze and control brain activity in this way. (Note that "task-related" has no definition other than changes occurring in any part of the brain being recorded from during the "task.")
But the reality is they can't. This whole review is describing the fruits of post hoc correlation-fishing, with the "findings" treated as causal rather than as simple, inevitable, coincidences. As I've tried to explain, if astrologers were held to the same criteria as neuroscientists today, they'd easily be able to get their articles published in Nature. The massive confounding entailed by the post hoc correlational approach in neuroscience have been discussed by Mehler and Kording (2018), and the problem is reflected in the widespread acknowledgement that contemporary "science" suffers from irreproducibility, as discussed, for example, in a series of articles compiled online by Nature (one of the worst offenders) in October 2018.
