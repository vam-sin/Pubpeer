It is very important that the author release publicly the raw data files used to support the many analyses used to make some large conclusions. This data is important also because the DOAJ is one prerequisite for Plan S. For example, it would be important to know precisely which journals of these publishers were "lost" from the DOAJ.

I quite agree, and have published all the data in conjunction with the article here https://doi.org/10.18710/KCL56N The link is also available from the article. Reference 21 contains a link to DOAJ's published data on journals added and removed, including a separate tab with all the journals removed due to their failure to submit a re-application https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/183mRBRqs2jOyP0qZWXN8dUd02D4vL0Mov_kgYF8HORM/edit#gid=1678073646
